# android-stuff
Tools and scripts I wrote and collected from various places to ease android hacking. Mostly stuff to modify ROMs and reverse APKs.

XDA is too full of people uploading JARs from whatever sources and wrapping them in shady .exe files, partly .NET wrappers that invoke `java -jar ...` via system.exec and other scary things. For my own work I try to wrap common things in bash scripts and try to provide a source for invoked .jar files wherever I can.
